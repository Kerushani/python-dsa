    "Amazon has introduced an innovative tool to explore the fascinating world of \"Word Conjugates\",\n",

    "The concept of conjugates follows a unique pairing mechanism where 'a' pairs with 'b'; 'c' pairs with 'd' and vice-versa. \n",

    "• There exists a permutation of the string such that the original string and its permutation are conjugates of each other.\n",
    "• Two strings s and t of the same length say n are considered conjugates if, for every index i (0 ≤ i < n), the pair \n",
    "formed by the characters at that index (s[i], t[i]) must be a conjugate pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string s that only contains the characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd'. Return the total number of valid substrings in \n",
    "the string s according to the specified conjugate rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "• Permutation of a string refers to any possible rearrangement of its characters. For example, the string \"cat\" has \n",
